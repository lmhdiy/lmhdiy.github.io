Welcome to my CS learning blog! I followed the cs learning route from [csdiy](https://csdiy.wiki/) and found my weakness on the basics. To push myself foward and then possess a systemic and solid foundation of computer science and related mathematics, I build this blog website. If you have any doubts on the content, email me at billymarx at qq.com. Good luck to you~
