Welcome to my CS learning blog! Iâ€™ve been following the CS learning path from csdiy and realized that I need to strengthen my fundamentals. To push myself forward and establish a systematic and solid foundation in computer science and related mathematics, I created this blog. If you have any questions about the content, feel free to email me at billymarx at qq.com. Best of luck on your journey!
